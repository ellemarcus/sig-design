## April 12, 2021


### Attendees
- Ed Warnicke
- Juhan Sonin
- Eriol Fox Reichelt (err-ol)

### Notes
- Ed is having trouble, a lot of it has more to do with the collateral available rather than the brand
- There are definitely website organization issues
    - Wordpress is an issue, that seems to be a blocker
- To summarize
    - We are not good at saying what we do in written forms
    - Corresponding mark/visual identity that doesn't communiate
    - The website doesn't communicate well enought
    - The community cannot manage the website
- Strong desire to make sure we do an open source design process
- LFPH brand background (https://lfpublichealth.slack.com/files/T01382K7DLP/F01QH54LWF8?origin_team=T01382K7DLP)
    - What is the creative direction you have in mind for LFPH brand logo?
        - we need to communicate openness, collaboration, and be a contemporary-feeling brand. But we are trying to appeal to government agencies, so shouldn’t feel “cutesy” or very out there. Needs to be professional.
        - Does not need to look or feel like the LF brand itself, though perhaps using one of the LF colors in our brand will help provide a little nod/link between the two
    - Use cases
        - So our logo is going to show up in “logo soup” slides pretty often, which means that it would be good if it can stand out from other logos.
            - For example: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/projects/
            - As a result, needs to be very easily legible both in stacked and horizontal forms
        - We need branding that can work well for a slide deck with a variety of colors for charts, etc.
            - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vshL5mprOj6p3eYnoUdUnCNzNHkh95ltuNTr86kU8-g/edit#slide=id.gaeb594928f_0_289
            - I’ve already had to manufacture colors for our palette because we were only given three shades of blue to begin with
        - Accessibility is very important - we need to have high-contrast colors and also colors so that colorblind can tell lines apart on our charts.
        - Social media. Needs to also be converted into a social media avatar for obvious reasons.
        - Things like our Slack logo to the left here
- Finding someone to be a design director who really can handle this and have a clear "the buck stops here"
