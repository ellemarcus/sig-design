# Branding Project Outline


## Goal

Research, design, and ship a Linux Foundation Public Health story, mark, and community-driven website that reflects the organization.

## People & Process

Live by open source rules: post early, post publicly, ask for feedback, iterate.  
Project lead: Jenny Wanger.   
Team: Eriol Fox, Ed Warnicke, Juhan Sonin, Chinaza Icheke and you!. 

Ask questions, critique on the LFPH slack.  
Bi-weekly open forums/meetings (every other Monday at 1p ET). 

## Meeting notes

All meeting notes are available [here](https://github.com/lfph/sig-design/blob/master/branding-task-force/meeting-notes.md).

## Tasks

Start with...
* The 1-liner: What is LFPH?
* The 1-pager: What is LFPH, its mission to open source public healthcare
* Who is our audience?
* See our [working document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/116dOf89xP8ksnskxkdyt6fTtyvX1VhDbL-rRUeJV4fM/edit?usp=sharing)

Next priority:
* The LFPH mark, the visual symbol(s)

Putting it all together:
